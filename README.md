# Create Bridge - A subsidized account creation contract

This is an EOSIO account creator contract that allows apps to assume portions of the costs for account creation.
As an app owner, you can define your app with createbridge contract specifying the owner/whitelisted account for the app. You can also specify the amount of ram, net and cpu you want for the new user accounts. 
As somebody who wants to contribute towards account creation whether it is the app owner or any other account, you can send the `createbridge` contract funds with the app `origin` and the percentage of RAM you want to subsidize in the memo. These funds will be used to pay for the user account.
Any contributor can reclaim their remaining balance at any point of time.

## Features

- Allow only the accounts registered with the app to take priviledge of the funds contributed for the app 
- Easy airdrops of app specific tokens with new account creation
- Reclaim remaining balance donated for an app at any point of time
- Selection of multiple contributors to maximise the % of RAM cost subsidized for a new account


### Define your app with createbridge

If you are an app, you can define a unique identifier for the app and register the `owner` account name for the app. 
You can also specify the amount of EOS for ram, net and cpu (in order) to give to the new user accounts. 
Also, if you wish to airdrop app tokens to the newly created account specify the airdrop contract, total airdrop supply
and the amount to airdrop to every new user account created. 
- `cleos push action createbridge define '[YOUR_ACCOUNT,app_name,ram,net,cpu,airdrop_contract,airdrop_tokens,airdrop_limit]'`
- `cleos push action createbridge define '["everipediabp","everipedia.org","1.0000 SYS","1.0000 SYS","1.0000 SYS","everipediaiq","1000000.0000 IQ","10.0000 IQ"]' -p eosio@active`

### Whitelist other accounts

You can whitelist other accounts, to create accounts on behalf of your app.
-  `cleos push action createbridge whitelist '[YOUR_ACCOUNT,account_name,app_name]'`

### Partial Costs

You can specify the app you want to contribute to along with the percentage of RAM cost you want to contribute, separated by comma in the memo field for transfer action.
- `cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "10.0000 EOS" "everipedia.org,50"`
- `cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "10.0000 EOS" "everipedia.org,100"`


### Globally Crowd-Free Accounts

Anyone can send EOS to this contract with the memo `free` to help fund completely free accounts for new EOS users.
- `cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "10.0000 EOS" "free"`


### Reclaim balance
- As a contributor, you can reclaim your balance at any time.
- You can specify the token symbol of the balance you want to reclaim:
    - Native token to reclaim chain symbol balance
    - Dapp token symbol to reclaim the remaining airdrop balance. Only to be reclaimed by the dapp owner
- `cleos push action createbridge reclaim '["YOUR_ACCOUNT","app_name","token_symbol"]' -p $CONTRIBUTOR

### Everyone can help!

Because of the way this contract works, anyone can help fund account creation for your app by simply sending amounts
to the contract with the app origin inside of the memo.
- `cleos transfer YOUR_ACCOUNT createbridge "10.0000 EOS" "everipedia.org,50"`

### Quick Start:
- Attach the code level permission to active permission of createbridge
    ./perms.sh

- Specify the token symbol for the chain and also the contract to call for newaccount action
    ./set.sh

### To test the code for a sampleapp
- Define a sampleapp and contributor for it
    ./define.sh
    ./contribute.sh

- Create a new user account for the sampleapp
    ./createaccount.sh

- Reclaim the contributed balance for the sampleapp
    ./reclaim.sh
